# Connect-4-Game
A Connect 4 game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allows players to compete in the classic strategy game where the objective is to connect four of their own discs in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The HTML structure provides the game board and controls, CSS styles the game to make it visually appealing, and JavaScript handles the game logic, including turn-taking, win detection, and updating the game state.
